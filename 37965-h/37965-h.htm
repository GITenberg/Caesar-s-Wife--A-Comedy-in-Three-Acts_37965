<div class="blockquotsce"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>The morning-room in the Consular Agent's house at Cairo.
The windows are Arabic in character and so are the architraves of
the doors, but otherwise it is an English room, airy and spacious.
The furniture is lacquer and Chippendale, there are cool chintzes
on the chairs and sofas, cut roses in glass vases, and growing
azaleas in pots; but here and there an Eastern antiquity, a helmet
and a coat of mail, a piece of woodwork, reminds one of the
Mussulman conquest of Egypt; while an ancient god in porphyry,
graven images in blue pottery, blue bowls, recall an older
civilisation still.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>When the curtain rises the room is empty, the blinds are down so
as to keep out the heat, and it is dim and mysterious. A</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>
<i>comes in, a dark-skinned native in the gorgeous uniform, red and
gold, of the Consular Agent's establishment, and draws the blinds.
Through the windows is seen the garden with palm-trees, oranges and
lemons, tropical plants with giant leaves; and beyond, the radiant
blue of the sky. In the distance is heard the plaintive, guttural
wailing of an Arab song. A</i> <span class="smcap">Gardener</span> <i>in a pale blue gaberdine
passes with a basket on his arm.</i></p></div>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Servant.</span></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Gardener.</span></p>

<p>U'alêkum es-Salâm warahmet Allâh wa barakâta (And with you be peace and
God's mercy and blessing).</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>goes out. The</i> <span class="smcap">Gardener</span> <i>stops for a moment to nail
back a straggling creeper and then goes on his way. The door is
opened.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby</span> <i>comes in with</i> <span class="smcap">Anne Etheridge</span> <i>and they are
followed immediately by</i> <span class="smcap">Violet</span>. <span class="smcap">Anne</span> <i>is a woman of forty, but
handsome still, very pleasant and sympathetic; she is a woman of
the world, tactful and self-controlled. She is dressed in light,
summery things.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby</span> <i>is an elderly, homely woman, soberly
but not inexpensively dressed. The wife of a North-country
manufacturer, she spends a good deal of money on rather dowdy
clothes.</i> <span class="smcap">Violet</span> <i>is a very pretty young woman of twenty. She looks
very fresh and English in her muslin frock; there is something
spring-like and virginal in her appearance, and her manner of dress
is romantic rather than modish. She suggests a lady in a
Gainsborough portrait rather than a drawing in a paper of Paris
fashions. Luncheon is just finished and when they come in the women
leave the door open for the men to follow.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>How cool it is in here! This isn't the room we were in before lunch?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>No. They keep the windows closed and the blinds drawn all the morning so
that it's beautifully cool when one comes in.<a name="page_003" id="page_003"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I suppose we shan't feel the heat so much when we've been here a few
days.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Oh, but this is nothing to what you'll get in Upper Egypt.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As she enters.</i>] Is Mrs. Appleby complaining of the heat? I love it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Dear Violet, wait till May comes and June. You don't know how exhausting
it gets.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I'm looking forward to it. I think in some past life I must have been a
lizard.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I dare say the first year you won't feel it. I have a brother settled in
Canada, and he says the first year people come out from England they
don't feel the cold anything like what they do later on.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I've spent a good many winters here, and I always make a point of
getting away by the fifteenth of March.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Oh, are you staying as late as that?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Good gracious, no. You make Lady Little's heart positively sink.<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense, Anne, you know we want you to stay as long as ever you can.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I used to have an apartment in Cairo, but I've given it up now and Lady
Little asked me to come and stay at the Agency while I was getting
everything settled.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Oh, then you knew Sir Arthur before he married?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, he's one of my oldest friends. I can't help thinking Lady
Little must have great sweetness of character to put up with me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Or you must be a perfect miracle of tact, darling.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>My belief is, it's a little of both.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>When Arthur came to see me one day last July and told me he was going to
marry the most wonderful girl in the world, of course I thought
good-bye. A man thinks he can keep his bachelor friendships, but he
never does.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>His wife generally sees to that.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Well, I think it's nonsense, especially with a man like Arthur who'd
been a bachelor so long and naturally<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a> had his life laid out before ever
I came into it. And besides, I'm devoted to Anne.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>It's dear of you to say so.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I came here as an absolute stranger. And after all, I wasn't very old,
was I?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Nineteen?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, I was older than that. I was nearly twenty.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Good gracious!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It was rather alarming to find oneself on a sudden the wife of a man in
Arthur's position. I was dreadfully self-conscious; I felt that
everybody's eyes were upon me. And you don't know how easy it is to make
mistakes in a country that's half Eastern and half European.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>To say nothing of having to deal with the representatives of half a
dozen Great Powers all outrageously susceptible.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>And, you know, there was the feeling that the smallest false step might
do the greatest harm to Arthur and his work here. I had only just left
the schoolroom and I found myself almost a political<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a> personage. If it
hadn't been for Anne I should have made a dreadful mess of things.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I don't think that. You had two assets which would have made people
excuse a great deal of inexperience, your grace and your beauty.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You say very nice things to me, Anne.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Your marriage was so romantic, I can't see how anyone could help feeling
very kindly towards you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>There's not much room for romance in the heart of the wife of one of the
Agents of the foreign Powers when she thinks she hasn't been given her
proper place at a dinner party.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I remember wondering at the time whether you weren't a little overcome
by all the excitement caused by your marriage.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I was excited too, you know.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Everyone had always looked upon Sir Arthur as a confirmed bachelor. It
was thought he cared for nothing but his work. He's had a wonderful
career, hasn't he?<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>The Prime Minister told me he was the most competent man he'd ever met.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I've always thought he must be a comfort to any Government. Whenever
anyone has made a hash of things he's been sent to put them straight.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Well, he always has.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Appleby was saying only this morning he was the last man one would
expect to marry in haste.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Let's hope he won't repent at leisure.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Mrs. Appleby is dying to know all about it, Violet.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I'm an old woman, Lady Little.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gaily.</i>] Well, I met Arthur at a week-end party. He'd come home on
leave and all sorts of important people had been asked to meet him. I
was frightened out of my life. The duchesses had strawberry leaves
hanging all over them and they looked at me down their noses. And the
Cabinet Ministers' wives had protruding teeth and they looked at me up
their noses.<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>What nonsense you talk, Violet!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I was expecting to be terrified of Arthur. After all, I knew he was a
great man. But you know, I wasn't a bit. He was inclined to be rather
fatherly at first, so I cheeked him.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I can imagine his surprise. No one had done that for twenty years.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>When you know Arthur at all well you discover that when he wants
anything he doesn't hesitate to ask for it. He told our hostess that he
wanted me to sit next to him at dinner. That didn't suit her at all, but
she didn't like to say no. Somehow people don't say no to Arthur. The
Cabinet Ministers' wives looked more like camels than ever, and by
Sunday evening, my dear, the duchesses' strawberry leaves began to curl
and crackle.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Your poor hostess, I feel for her. To have got hold of a real lion for
your party and then have him refuse to bother himself with anybody but a
chit of a girl whom you'd asked just to make an even number!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>He just fell in love with you at first sight?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>That's what he says now.<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Did you know?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I thought it looked very like it, you know, only it was so improbable.
Then came an invitation from a woman I only just knew for the next
week-end, and she said Arthur would be there. Then my heart really did
begin to go pit-a-pat. I took the letter in to my sister and sat on her
bed and we talked it over. "Does he mean to propose to me," I said, "or
does he not?" And my sister said: "I can't imagine what he sees in you.
Will you accept him if he does?" she asked. "Oh, no," I said. "Good
heavens, why he's twenty years older than I am!" But of course I meant
to all the time. I shouldn't have cared if he was a hundred, he was the
most wonderful man I'd ever known.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>And did he propose to you that week-end, when he'd practically only seen
you once before?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I got down in the afternoon and he was there already. As soon as I
swallowed a cup of tea he said: "Come out for a walk." Well, I'd have
loved a second cup, but I didn't like to say so, so I went. But we had a
second tea in a cottage half an hour later, and we were engaged then.</p>

really he talks it as well as I do, only he won't.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Osman Pasha.</span></p>

<p>C'est une bien belle langue, et vous, madame, vous avez autant
d'intelligence que de beauté.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I have a Copt who comes to me every day. And I practise a little with
your brother, Anne.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby</span>.] My brother is one of Sir Arthur's secretaries. I
expect it was he that Mr. Appleby left with Sir Arthur.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>If it is I shall scold him. He knows quite well that he has no right to
come and bother Arthur when he's in the bosom of his family. But they
say he's a wonderful Arabic scholar.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Osman Pasha.</span></p>

<p>Vous parlez de M. Parry? Je n'ai jamais connu un Anglais qui avait une
telle facilité.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>He says he's never known an Englishman who speaks so well as Ronny.<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It's a fearfully difficult language. Sometimes my head seems to get tied
up in knots.</p>

<p>[<i>Two</i> <span class="smcap">Saises</span> <i>come in, one with a salver on which are coffee cups and
the other bearing a small tray on which is a silver vessel containing
Turkish coffee. They go round giving coffee to the various people, then

go out.</i>]</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>It's wonderful of you to persevere.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, you know, Ronny's very encouraging. He says I'm really getting on. I
want so badly to be able to talk. You can't think how enthusiastic I am
about Egypt. I love it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Osman Pasha.</span></p>

<p>Pas plus que l'Égypte vous aime, Madame.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>When we landed at Alexandria and I saw that blue sky and that coloured,
gesticulating crowd, my heart leapt. I knew I was going to be happy. And
every day I've loved Egypt more. I love its antiquities, I love the
desert and the streets of Cairo and those dear little villages by the
Nile. I never knew there was such beauty in the world. I thought you
only read of romance in books; I didn't know there was a country where
it sat by the side of a well under the palm-trees, as though it were at
home.<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Osman Pasha.</span></p>

<p>Vous êtes charmante, madame. C'est un bien beau pays. Il n'a besoin que
d'une chose pour qu'on puisse y vivre.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Translating.</i>] It's a beautiful country. It only wants one thing to
make it livable. And what is that, your Excellency?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Osman Pasha.</span></p>

<p>La liberté.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Liberty?</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Arthur</span> <i>has come in when first</i> <span class="smcap">Violet</span> <i>begins to speak of Egypt and he

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Egypt has the liberty to do well, your Excellency. Does it need the
liberty to do ill before it loses the inclination to do it?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby</span>.] I hope you don't mind Turkish coffee?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, I like it.<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I'm so glad. I think it perfectly delicious.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You have in my wife an enthusiastic admirer of this country, Pasha.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Osman Pasha.</span></p>

<p>J'en suis ravi.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I've told Ronny to come in and have a cup of coffee. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Anne</span>.] I
thought you'd like to say how d'you do to him.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Are you very busy to-day?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>We're always busy. Isn't that so, Excellency?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Osman Pasha.</span></p>

<p>En effet, et je vous demanderai permission de me retirer. Mon bureau
m'appelle.</p>

<p>[<i>He gets up and shakes hands with</i> <span class="smcap">Violet</span>.]</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It was charming of you to come.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Osman Pasha.</span></p>

<p>Mon Dieu, madame, c'est moi qui vous remercie de m'avoir donné
l'occasion de saluer votre grâce et votre beauté.</p>

<p>[<i>He bows to the rest of the company.</i> <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> <i>leads him towards the
door and he goes out.</i>]<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>You take all these compliments without turning a hair, Violet.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coming back.</i>] You know, that's a wonderful old man. He's so
well-bred, he has such exquisite manners, it's hard to realise that if
it were possible he would have us all massacred to-morrow.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I remember there was a certain uneasiness in England when you
recommended that he should be made Minister of Education.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>They don't always understand local conditions in England. Osman is a
Moslem of the old school. He has a bitter hatred of the English. In
course of years he has come to accept the inevitable, but he's not
resigned to it. He never loses sight of his aim.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>And that is?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Why, bless you, to drive the English into the sea. But he's a clever old
rascal, and he sees that one of the first things that must be done is to
educate the Egyptians. Well, we want to educate them too. I had all
sorts of reforms in mind which I would never have got the strict
Mohammedans to accept if they hadn't been brought forward by a man whose
patriotism they believe in and whose orthodoxy is beyond suspicion.<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Don't you find it embarrassing to work with a man you distrust?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I don't distrust him. I have a certain admiration for him, and I bear
him no grudge at all because at the bottom of his heart he simply
loathes me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I don't see why he should do that.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I was in Egypt for three years when I was quite a young man. I was very
small fry then, but I came into collision with Osman and he tried to
poison me. I was very ill for two months, and he's never forgiven me
because I recovered.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>What a scoundrel!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>He would be a little out of place in a Nonconformist community. In the
good old days of Ismael he had one of his wives beaten to death and
thrown into the Nile.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>But is it right to give high office to a man of that character?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>They were the manners and customs of the times.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>But he tried to kill you. Don't you bear him any ill will?<a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I don't think it was very friendly, you know, but after all no statesman
can afford to pay attention to his private feelings. His duty is to find
the round peg for the round hole and put him in.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Why does he come here?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>He has a very great and respectful admiration for Violet. She chaffs
him, if you please, and the old man adores her. I think she's done more
to reconcile him to the British occupation than all our diplomacy.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>It must be wonderful to have power in a country like this.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Power? Oh, I haven't that. But it makes me so proud to think I can be of
any use at all. I only wish I had the chance to do more. Since I've been
here I've grown very patriotic.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Ronald Parry</span> <i>comes in. He is a young man, very good-looking, fresh and
pleasant, with a peculiar charm of manner.</i>]</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Ah, here is Ronny.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>Am I too late for my cup of coffee?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>No, it will be brought to you at once.<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking hands with</i> <span class="smcap">Violet</span>.] Good morning.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>This is Mr. Parry. Mr. and Mrs. Appleby.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>How d'you do?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Now, Ronny, don't put on your Foreign Office manner. Mr. and Mrs.
Appleby are very nice people.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I'm glad you think that, Sir Arthur.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Well, when you left your cards with a soup ticket from the F.O. my heart
sank.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>There, my dear, I told you he wouldn't want to be bothered with us.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You see, I expected a pompous couple who knew all about everything and
were going to tell me exactly how Egypt ought to be governed. A Member
of Parliament doesn't inspire confidence in the worried bosom of a
Government official.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I don't know if you think you're putting Mr. and Mrs. Appleby at their
ease, Arthur.<a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Oh, but I shouldn't say this if I hadn't been most agreeably
disappointed.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I never forget the days when Mr. Appleby used to light the kitchen fire
himself and I used to do the week's washing every Monday morning. I
don't think we've changed much since then, either of us.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I know, and I'm really grateful to the Foreign Office for having given
you your letter.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>It's been a great treat to us to come and see you. And it's done my
heart good to see Lady Little. If you don't mind my saying so she's like
a spring morning and it makes one glad to be alive just to look at her.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, don't!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I'm inclined to feel very kindly to everyone who feels kindly towards
her. You must enjoy yourselves in Upper Egypt and when you come back to
Cairo you must let us know.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I'm expecting to learn a good deal from my journey.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You may learn a good deal that will surprise you. You may learn that
there are races in the world that<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a> seem born to rule and races that seem
born to serve; that democracy is not a panacea for all the ills of
mankind, but merely one system of government like another, which hasn't
had a long enough trial to make it certain whether it is desirable or
not; that freedom generally means the power of the strong to oppress the
weak, and that the wise statesman gives men the illusion of it but not
the substance&mdash;in short, a number of things which must be very
disturbing to the equilibrium of a Radical Member of Parliament.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, you'll see our beautiful Nile and the temples.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>And perhaps they'll suggest to you that however old the world is it's
ever young, and that when all's said and done the most permanent on the
face of the earth is what seems the most transitory&mdash;the ideal.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Fanny, it looks to me as though we'd bitten off as big a piece of cake
as we can chew with any comfort.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Oh, well, we'll do our best. And though I never could do arithmetic I've
always thought perhaps one might be saved without. Good-bye, Lady
Little, and thank you for having us.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Good-bye.</p>

<p>[<i>There are general farewells and they go to the door.</i> <span class="smcap">Ronny</span> <i>opens it

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>I forgot to tell you, sir, Mrs. Pritchard has just telephoned to ask if
she can see you on a matter of business.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a grim smile.</i>] Say I'm very busy to-day, and I regret
exceedingly that it will be quite impossible for me to see her.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a twinkle in his eye.</i>] She said she was coming round at once.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>If she's made up her mind to see me at all costs she might have saved
herself the trouble of ringing up to find out if it was convenient.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Your sister is a determined creature, Arthur.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I know. I have some authority in the affairs of this country, but none
over dear Christina. I wonder what she wants.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Let us hope for the best.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I've noticed that whenever anyone wants to see me very urgently it's
never to give me anything. When Christina wants to see me urgently my
only safety is in instant flight.<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You must be nice to her, Arthur. If you're not she'll only take it out
of me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It's monstrous, isn't it?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>After all, she kept house for you for ten years. Admirably, mind you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Admirably. She has a genius for order and organisation in the house.
Everything went like clockwork. She never wasted a farthing. She saved
me hundreds of pounds. She led me a dog's life. I've come to the
conclusion there's nothing so detestable as a good housekeeper.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>How fortunate you married me, then! But you can't expect her to see that
point of view. It's very hard for her to be turned out of this very
pleasant billet, and it's natural that when you won't do something she
asks you she should put it down to my influence.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>It must have been a very difficult position for you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I did all I could to make her like me. I did feel rather like a usurper,
you know. I tried to make her see that I didn't at all want to put on
airs.<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Fortunately she's taken it very well. I confess I was a little nervous
when she told me she meant to stay on in Egypt to be near her son.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>It would be a detestable person who didn't like Violet, I think.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Detestable. I should have no hesitation in having him deported.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>I think I'd better be getting back to my work.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Ronny, would you like me to come and help you with your packing?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Ronny</span>.] Are you going somewhere?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>I'm leaving Cairo.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Didn't you know? Ronny has just been appointed to Paris.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Is he going to leave Egypt for good?</p>

<p>[<i>She is taken aback by the news. She clenches her hand on the rail of a

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>I suppose so.<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>But why was it kept from me? Why have you been making a secret of it?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Darling, no one's been making a secret of it. I&mdash;I thought Anne would
have told you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, it doesn't matter at all, but Ronny has been in the habit of doing
all sorts of things for me. It would have been convenient if I'd been
told that a change was going to be made.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I'm very sorry. It was only arranged this morning. I received a telegram
from the Foreign Office. I thought it would interest Anne, so I sent
Ronny along to tell her.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I hate to be treated like a child.</p>

<p>[<i>There is a moment's embarrassment.</i>]</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>It was stupid of me. I ought to have come and told you. I was so pleased
and excited that I forgot.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I don't quite know why you should have been so excited.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>It will be very nice for me to have Ronny so near. You see, now I've
given up my flat I shan't come to<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a> Egypt very often and I should never
have seen Ronny. I can run over to Paris constantly. Besides, it's a
step, isn't it? And I want to see him an Ambassador before I die.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I don't see what good it will do him in Paris to speak Arabic like a
native.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Oh, well, that is the F.O. all over. The best Persian scholar in the
Service has spent the last six years in Washington.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>It's been a great surprise for me. I expected to remain in Egypt
indefinitely.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Recovering herself.</i>] I expect you'll have a very good time in Paris.
When do you go?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>There's a boat the day after to-morrow. Sir Arthur thought I'd better
take that.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Scarcely mistress of herself.</i>] As soon as that! [<i>Recovering,
gaily.</i>] We shall miss you dreadfully. I can't imagine what I shall do

since I came here.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>It's very kind of you to say so.<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>He's invaluable at functions and things like that. You see, he knows
where everyone should sit at dinner. And at first he used to coach me
with details about various people so that I shouldn't say the wrong
thing.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>If you had you'd have said it so charmingly that no one would have
resented it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I'm so afraid that the man who takes Ronny's place will refuse to write
my invitations for me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It's not exactly the duty of my secretaries.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>No, but I do hate doing it myself. And Ronny was able to imitate my
handwriting.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, he could. Couldn't you?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>I managed to write quite enough like you for people not to notice the
difference.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You know, there are thirty-two invitations to do now.<a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Why don't you send cards?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I think a letter is so much more polite. Somehow I don't feel old
enough to ask people to dine with me in the third person.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>I'll come and do them the moment Sir Arthur can let me go.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You'd better do them before Violet goes out.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>That'll be very soon. The Khedive's mother has asked me to go and see
her at half-past three. I'll get the list now, shall I? I don't think
I'll wait for Christina. If she wants to see you on business I dare say
she'd rather I wasn't there.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Very well.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Ronny.</span>] Will you come here when you're ready?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<p>[<i>She goes out.</i>]</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Have you finished that report yet?<a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>Not quite, sir. It will be ready in ten minutes.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Put it on my desk.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>All right, sir.</p>

<p>[<i>Exit.</i> <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Anne</span> <i>are left alone. He looks at her
reflectively.</i>]</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Violet is very sensitive to anything that might be considered a slight.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>It's very natural, isn't it? A high-spirited girl.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>She likes me to tell her my arrangements. It gives her a little feeling
of importance to know things before other people.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Oh, of course. I quite understand. I should do the same in her place.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I ought to have remembered and told her that Ronny was going. She was
just a little vexed because she thought I'd been fixing things up behind
her back.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I know. It would naturally put her out for a moment to learn on a
sudden that one of the persons she'd been thrown in contact with was
going away.<a name="page_029" id="page_029"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a twinkle in his eye.</i>] I'm wondering if I must blame you for the
loss of an excellent secretary.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Me?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I don't know why the F.O. should suddenly have made up their minds that
your brother was wanted in Paris. Have you been pulling strings?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] What a suspicious nature you have!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Anne, own up.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I thought Ronny was getting into a groove here. There didn't seem to be
much more for him to do than he has been doing for some time. If you
<i>will</i> have the truth, I've been moving heaven and earth to get him
moved.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>How deceitful of you not to have said a word about it!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I didn't want to make him restless. I knew he'd be mad to go to Paris. I
thought it much better not to say anything till it was settled.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>D'you think he's mad to go to Paris?<a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Fencing with him.</i>] Any young man would be.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I wonder if he'd be very much disappointed if I made other arrangements.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean, Arthur? You wouldn't prevent him from going when I've
done everything in the world to get him away.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Abruptly.</i>] Why should you be so anxious for him to go?</p>

<p>[<i>She looks at him for an instant in dismay.</i>]</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens, don't speak so sharply to me. I told Violet just now. I
wanted him to be more get-at-able. I think he stands a much better
chance of being noticed if he's in a place like Paris.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] Ah, yes, you said you were coming less frequently to
Egypt than in the past. It might be worth while to keep Ronny here in
order to tempt you back.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Egypt isn't the same to me that it was.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I hope my marriage has made no difference to our friendship, Anne. You
know how deeply I value it.<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>You used to come and see me very often. You knew I was discreet and you
used to talk over with me all sorts of matters which occupied you. I was
pleased and flattered. Of course I realised that those pleasant
conversations of ours must stop when you married. I only came here this
winter to collect my goods and chattels.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You make me feel vaguely guilty towards you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Of course you're nothing of the sort. But I don't want Violet to feel
that I am making any attempt to&mdash;to monopolise you. She's been charming
to me. The more I know her the more delightful I find her.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It's very nice of you to say so.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>You know I've always had a great admiration for you. I'm so glad to see
you married to a girl who's not unworthy of you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I suppose it was a dangerous experiment for a man of my age to marry a
girl of nineteen.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I think one can admit that. But you've always been one of the favourites
of the gods. You've made a wonderful success of it.<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It needs on a husband's part infinite tact, patience, and tolerance.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>You have the great advantage that Violet is genuinely in love with you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I suppose only a fatuous ass would confess that a beautiful girl was in
love with him.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>You make her very happy.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>There's nothing I wouldn't do to achieve that. I'm more desperately in
love with Violet even than when I first married her.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I'm so glad. <i>I</i> want nothing but your happiness.</p>

<p>[<i>Kissing him.</i>] How is Violet?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Lovely.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I was inquiring about her health.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Her health is perfect.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>At her age one's always well, I suppose. [<i>Kissing</i> <span class="smcap">Anne</span>.] How d'you do?
And how are you, my poor Arthur?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You ask me as though I was a doddering old gentleman, crippled with
rheumatism. I'm in the best of health, thank you very much, and very
active for my years. [<span class="smcap">Christina</span> <i>has seen a flower on the table that has

do you do that?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I don't like untidiness.<a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p>[<i>He takes the flower out again and places it on the table.</i>]</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I was expecting to find you in your office.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Do you think I'm neglecting my work? I thought it more becoming to wait
for you here.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I wanted to see you on a matter of business.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>So I understood from your message. I feel convinced you're going to put
me in the way of making my fortune.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I'll leave you, shall I?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, pray don't. There's not the least reason why you shouldn't hear
what it's all about.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You're not going to make my fortune after all. You're going to ask me to
do something.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>What makes you think that?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You want a third person present to be witness to my brutal selfishness
when I refuse. I know you, Christina.<a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] You're much too sensible to refuse a perfectly reasonable
request.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Let us hear it. [<i>She sits down on the sofa. The cushions have been
disordered by people sitting on them and she shakes them out, and pats

furniture alone, Christina.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I cannot make out what pleasure people take in seeing things out of
their proper place.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You're very long in coming to the point.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I hear that the Khedive has quarrelled with his secretary.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You're a marvellous woman, Christina. You get hold of all the harem
gossip.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>It's true, isn't it?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Yes. But I only heard of it myself just before luncheon. How did it come
to your ears?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>That doesn't matter, does it? I have a way of hearing things that may be
of interest to me.<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid I'm very dense, but I don't see how it can be of any
particular interest to you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Dear Arthur. The Khedive has asked you to recommend him an
English secretary.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Has he really? That's a change. He's never had an English secretary
before.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Never.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>It's a wonderful opportunity.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>If we get the right man he can be of the greatest possible help. If he's
tactful, wise, and courteous, there's no reason why in time he shouldn't
attain very considerable influence over the Khedive. If we can really
get the Khedive to work honestly and sincerely with us, instead of
hampering us by all kinds of secret devices, we can do miracles in this
country.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>What a splendid chance for the man who gets the job!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I suppose it is. If he has the right qualities he may achieve anything.
And after all, it's a splendid chance to be able to render such great
service to our own old country.<a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Has the Khedive given any particulars about the sort of man he wants?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>He naturally wants a young man and a good sportsman. It's important that
he should be able to speak Arabic. But the qualifications which will
satisfy the Khedive are nothing beside those which will satisfy me. The
wrong man may cause irreparable damage to British interests.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Have you thought that Henry would be admirably suited?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I can't say I have, Christina.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>He's young and he's very good at games. He speaks Arabic.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Quite well, I believe. I think he's very well suited to the post he has.
It would be a pity to disturb him when he's just got at home with the
work.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Arthur, you can't compare a very badly paid job in the Ministry of
Education with a private secretaryship to the Khedive.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>The best job for a man is the one he's most fitted to do.<a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>You've got no fault to find with Henry. He's a very good worker, he's
honest, industrious, and painstaking.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You don't praise a pair of boots because you can walk in them without
discomfort; if you can't you chuck them away.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>What d'you mean by that?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>The qualities you mention really don't deserve any particular reward. If
Henry hadn't got them I'd fire him without a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I have no doubt you'd welcome the opportunity. It's the greatest
misfortune of Henry's life that he happens to be your nephew.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, it's counterbalanced by his extraordinary good luck
in being your son.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>You've stood in his way on every possible occasion.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Good-humouredly.</i>] You know that's not true, Christina. I've refused
to perpetrate a number of abominable jobs that you've urged me to. He's
had his chances as everyone else has. You're an admirable mother. If I'd
listened to you he'd be Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister by now.<a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I've never asked you to do anything for Henry that wasn't perfectly
reasonable.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It's evident then that we have different views upon what is reasonable.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I appeal to you, Anne: do you see any objection to suggesting Henry to
the Khedive as a private secretary?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I knew that's what she wanted you here for, Anne, to be a witness to my
pig-headed obstinacy.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Don't be absurd, Arthur. I'm asking Anne for an unprejudiced opinion.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Anne is unlikely to have an opinion of any value on a matter she knows
nothing about.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] That is a very plain hint that I can't do better
than hold my tongue. I'll take it, Christina.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>It's so unreasonable of you, Arthur. You won't listen to any argument.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>The only one you've offered yet is: here's a good job going, Henry's
your nephew, give it him. My<a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a> dear, don't you see the Khedive would
never accept such a near relation of mine?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I don't agree with you at all. The fact of his asking you to recommend
an English secretary shows that he wants to draw the connection between
you and himself closer. After all, you might give the boy a chance.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>This is not an occasion when one can afford to give a chance. It's hit
or miss. If the man I choose is a failure the Khedive will never ask me
to do such a thing for him again. I can't take any risks.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Will you tell me what qualifications Henry lacks to make him suitable
for the post?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Certainly. It's true he speaks Arabic, but he doesn't understand the
native mind. Grammars can't teach you that, my dear, only sympathy. He
has the mind of an official. I often think that you must have swallowed
a ramrod in early life and poor Henry was born with a foot-rule in his
inside.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I am not amused, Arthur.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I have no doubt in course of time he'll become a very competent
official, but he'll never be anything else. He lacks imagination, and
that is just as necessary to a statesman as to a novelist. Finally he
has no charm.<a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>How can you judge? You're his uncle. You might just as well say I have
no charm.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You haven't. You're an admirable woman, with all the substantial virtues
which make you an ornament to your sex, but you have no charm.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a grim smile.</i>] I should be a fool if I expected you to pay me
compliments, shouldn't I?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You would at all events be a woman who is unable to learn by experience.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Besides, I don't agree with you. I think Henry has charm.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Why do we all call him Henry? Why does Henry suit him so admirably? If
he had charm we would naturally call him Harry.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Really, Arthur, it amazes me that a man in your position can be
influenced by such absurd trifles. It's so unfair, when a boy has a
dozen solid real virtues that you should refuse to recommend him for a
job because he hasn't got in your opinion a frivolous, unsubstantial
advantage like charm.<a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Unsubstantial it may be, but frivolous it certainly isn't. Believe me,
charm is the most valuable asset that any man can have. D'you think it
sounds immoral to say it compensates for the lack of brains and virtue?
Alas! it happens to be true. Brains may bring you to power, but charm
enables you to keep it. Without charm you will never lead men.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>And do you imagine you're likely to find a young Englishman who's a
sportsman and an Arabic scholar, who has tact, imagination, sympathy,
wisdom, courtesy and charm?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>If you do, Arthur, I'm afraid he won't remain here very long, because I
warn you, I shall insist on marrying him.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It's not so formidable as it sounds. I'm going to suggest Ronny.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>It's the last thing that would ever have entered my head.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I thought you'd made all arrangements for sending him away.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I made no arrangements at all. I received a telegram from the F.O.
saying that he'd been appointed to Paris.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a very short pause.</i>] Don't you think you'd better leave it at
that?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>No, I don't. I'm going to wire to London explaining the circumstances
and suggesting that I think him very suitable for the post that's just
offered itself.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Trying to take it lightly.</i>] I feel rather aggrieved, after all the
efforts I've made to get him appointed to Paris.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Oh, he owes that to you, does he? You thought it would be better for him
to leave here?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Deliberately.</i>] I don't quite understand what you're driving at,

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking him up defiantly.</i>] I cannot imagine anyone more unsuitable
than Ronald Parry.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>That is for me to judge, isn't it?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps the Foreign Office will say they see no reason to change their
mind.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I don't think so.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Have you told Ronny?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>No, I thought it unnecessary till I'd found out whether the Khedive
would be willing to take him.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I'm amazed, Arthur. When Henry told me Ronald Parry was going I couldn't
help thinking it was very desirable.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Christina knows that I shall be very little in Egypt in future and how

each other as we can.<a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] It really amuses me that you should refuse to give a

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>No, I'm trying to get the moon for you just now, darling, and I thought
if I gave her the earth it really would upset the universe a little too
much.</p>

<p>Of course you are older this afternoon, that's quite true.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>What have I done? I made up my mind that no one should ever know. I
thought then it wouldn't matter. It needn't prevent me from doing my
duty to Arthur. It didn't interfere with my affection for him. I didn't
see how it could hurt anyone if I kept my love for you locked up in my
heart, tightly, and it made me so happy. I rejoiced in it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

I feel we're made for one another.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, don't talk of that. D'you suppose I haven't said to myself: "Oh, if
I'd only met him first"? Oh, Ronny, Ronny, Ronny!</p>

<p>Oh, Violet, why didn't you wait for me?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I made a mistake. I must pay for it. Arthur's so good and kind. He loves
me with all his heart. Oh, what a fool I was! I didn't know what love
was. I feel that my life is finished, and I'm so young, Ronny.<a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a></p>

<p>My dear one. [<i>They stand, face to face, looking at one another

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>But surely when we're out of our own country we're foreigners.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense, Anne, we're English. I wonder Arthur allows Violet to learn
Arabic. I can't help thinking it'll make a bad impression on the
natives. <i>I</i> managed this house on fifty words of Arabic.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I'm convinced that on a hundred you'd be prepared to manage
the country.<a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I don't think you can deny that I did my work here competently.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>You're a wonderful housekeeper.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I have common sense and a talent for organisation. [<i>Pursing her lips.</i>]
It breaks my heart to see the way certain things are done here now.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>You must remember Violet is very young.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Much too young to be a suitable wife for Arthur.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>He seems to be very well satisfied, and after all he is the person most
concerned.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I know. His infatuation is&mdash;blind, don't you think?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coolly.</i>] I think it's very delightful to see two people so much in
love with one another.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>D'you know that I used to be fearfully jealous of you, Anne?<a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Amused.</i>] I know that you thoroughly disliked me, Christina. You
didn't trouble to hide it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I was always afraid that Arthur would marry you. I didn't want to be
turned out of this house. I suppose you think that's horrid of me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>No, I think it's very natural.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I didn't see why Arthur should marry. I gave him all the comforts of
home life. And I thought it would interfere with his work. Of course I
knew that he liked you. I suffered agonies when he used to go and dine
with you quietly. [<i>With a sniff.</i>] He said it rested him.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps it did. Did you grudge him that?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I knew you were desperately in love with him.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Need you throw that in my face now? Really, I haven't deserved it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>My dear, I wish he had married you. It never struck me he'd marry a girl
twenty years younger than himself.<a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>He never looked upon me as anything but a friend. I don't suppose it
occurred to him for an instant that my feeling might possibly be
different.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>It was stupid of me. I ought to have given him a hint.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] You took care not to do that, Christina. Perhaps you
knew that was all it wanted.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Reflectively.</i>] I don't think he's treated you very well.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense. A man isn't obliged to marry a woman just because she's in
love with him. I don't see why loving should give one a claim on the
person one loves.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>You would have made him a splendid wife.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>So will Violet, my dear. Most men have the wives they deserve.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I marvel at your kindness to her. You're so tolerant and sympathetic,
one would never imagine she's robbed you of what you wanted most in the
world.<a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I shouldn't respect myself very much if I bore her the shadow of a
grudge. I'm so glad that she's sweet and charming and ingenuous; it
makes it very easy to be fond of her.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I know. I wanted to dislike her. But I can't really. There is something
about her which disarms one.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Isn't it lucky? It's a difficult position. That irresistible charm of
hers will make everything possible. After all, you and I can agree in
that we both want Arthur to be happy.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I wonder if there's much chance of that.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Anne</span> <i>looks at her for a moment inquiringly, and</i> <span class="smcap">Christina</span>
<i>coolly returns the stare</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Why did you come here this afternoon, Christina?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a faint smile.</i>] Why did you take so much trouble to get your
brother moved to Paris?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens, I told you this morning.<a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>D'you think we need make pretences with one another?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I don't think I quite understand.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Don't you? You wanted Ronny to leave Egypt because you know he's in love
with Violet.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>For a moment</i> <span class="smcap">Anne</span> <i>is a little taken aback, but she quickly
recovers herself</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>He's very susceptible. He's always falling in and out of love. I had
noticed that he was attracted, and I confess I thought it better to put
him out of harm's way.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>How cunning you are, Anne! You won't admit anything till you're quite
certain the person you're talking to knows it. You know as well as I do
that Violet is just as much in love with him.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Much disturbed.</i>] Christina, what are you going to do? How could I
help knowing? You've only got to see the way they look at one another.
They're sick with love.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>What did Arthur expect? I've never seen a couple more admirably suited
to one another.<a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I thought no one knew but me till this morning, when you were talking to
Arthur. Then I thought you must know too. My heart was in my mouth, I
was afraid you were going to tell him. But you didn't, and I thought I'd
been mistaken.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>You didn't give me credit for very nice feeling, Anne. Because I didn't
act like a perfect beast you thought I must be a perfect fool.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I know how devoted you are to your son. I didn't believe you'd stick at
anything when his interests were at stake. I'm sorry, Christina.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Pray don't apologise. I didn't know it myself. It was on the tip of my
tongue to tell Arthur, but I simply couldn't. I couldn't do anything so
shabby.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Christina, we mustn't ever let him know, we can't make him so
miserable. It would break his heart.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Well, what is to be done?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Heaven knows. I've been racking my brains. I can think of nothing. I'd
arranged everything so<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a> beautifully. And now I'm helpless. I thought
even of going to Ronny and asking him to refuse any job that will keep
him here. But Arthur looks upon it as so important. He'll insist on
Ronny's accepting unless his reasons for going are&mdash;what's the word I
want?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Irrefutable. It seems very hard that my boy should be done out of such a
splendid chance by Ronny. Except for your brother I'm sure Arthur would
give it to Henry.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Diplomatically.</i>] I know he has the highest opinion of Henry's
abilities.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>You can't expect me to sit still and let things go on.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Arthur is perfectly unconscious. He thinks Violet is as much in love
with him as he is with her. You couldn't be so cruel as to hint anything
to him.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>How you adore him, Anne! You may set your mind at rest. I'm not going to
say a word to Arthur. I'm going to speak to Violet.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Frightened.</i>] What are you going to say?<a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I'm going to ask her to do all she can to persuade Arthur to give Henry
the job. And then Ronny can go to Paris.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>You're not going to tell her you know?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Deliberately.</i>] If it's necessary she must make Ronny refuse the
appointment. He must invent some excuse that Arthur will accept.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>But it's blackmail.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I don't care what it is.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Violet</span> <i>comes in. She wears an afternoon gown, picturesque and
simple, yet elegant enough for the visit she has been paying. She
has a large hat, which she presently removes.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Here is Violet.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, you poor people, haven't you had any tea?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I thought we'd wait till you came back. It'll come at once now.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>How are you, Christina? How is Henry? [<i>They kiss one another.</i>] I've
not seen him for days.<a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>He's coming to fetch me presently.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I shall tell him he neglects me. He's the only one of my in-laws I'm not
a little afraid of.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>He's a good boy.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>He has a good mother. I thought it would be such fun having a nephew
several years older than myself, but he won't treat me as an aunt. He
will call me Violet. I tell him he ought to be more respectful.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Meanwhile</i> <span class="smcap">Servants</span> <i>have brought the tea</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>What have you been doing this afternoon?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I went to see the Khedive's mother. She made me eat seventeen
different things and I feel exactly like a boa-constrictor. [<i>Looking at
the cakes and scones.</i>] I'm afraid there's not a very nice tea.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>So I notice.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] I suppose I couldn't persuade you to pour it out.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gratified.</i>] Certainly, if you wish it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She sits down in front of the teapot and pours out cups of tea.</i>
<span class="smcap">Arthur</span> <i>comes in</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Hulloa, Christina, are you pouring out the tea?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Violet asked me to.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>If only I weren't here it would be quite like old times.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I understand you want to see me, Violet.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I hope you haven't come out here on purpose. I sent the message that
I wished to have a word with you when convenient, but I didn't want to
hurry you. I was quite prepared to go to you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>That sounds very formidable. I had a few minutes to spare while some
letters were being prepared for me to sign. But in any case I'm always
at your service.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>The Khedive's mother has asked me to talk to you about a man called
Abdul Said.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>She thought if I put the circumstances before you....</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] What has he got to do with her?<a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>He's been employed for years on an estate of hers up the Nile. His
mother was one of her maids. It appears she gave her a dowry when she
married.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I see. I gathered that Abdul Said had powerful influence
somewhere or other.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Who is this man, Arthur?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>He's been sentenced to death for murder. It was a perfectly clear case,
but there was a lot of perjury and we had some difficulty in getting a
conviction. What has the Princess asked you to do?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>She explained the whole thing to me, and then she asked if I wouldn't
intercede with you. I promised to do everything I could.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You shouldn't have done that. The old lady knows quite well an affair of
this sort is no business of yours. I wish you'd told her so.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Arthur, what could I do? His wife was there, and his mother. If you'd
seen them.... I couldn't bear to look at their misery and do nothing. I
said I was sure that when you knew all the facts you'd reprieve the
man.<a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It's not in my power to do anything of the sort. The prerogative of
mercy is with the Khedive.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I know, but if you advise him to exercise it he will. He's only too
anxious to, but he won't move without your advice.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It's monstrous of the Princess to try and make use of you in this way.
She prepared a complete trap for you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>What did the man do exactly?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It's rather a peculiar case. Abdul Said had a difference of opinion with
an Armenian merchant and shortly after his only son fell ill and died.
He took it into his head that the Armenian had cast the evil eye on him,
and he took his gun, waited for his opportunity, and shot the Armenian
dead. The man isn't a criminal in the ordinary sense of the word, but we
can't afford to make exceptions. If we did there'd be a crop of murders
with the same excuse. I looked into the case this morning and I see no
reason to advise the Khedive to interfere with the course of justice.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>This morning? When you came in to luncheon full of spirits, laughing and
chaffing, had you just sent a man to his death? How horribly callous!<a name="page_070" id="page_070"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I'm sorry you should think that. I give every matter my closest
attention, and when I've settled it to the best of my ability I put it
out of my mind. I think it would be just as unwise to let it affect me
as for a doctor to let himself be affected by his patients' sufferings.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It seems to me horrible to slaughter that wretched man because he's
ignorant and simple-minded. Don't you see that for yourself?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid I'm not here to interpret the law according to my feelings
but according to its own spirit.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It's easy to talk like that when you haven't got any feeling one way or
the other. Don't you realise the misery of that man condemned to die for
what he honestly thought was a mere act of justice? I wish you'd seen
the agony of those poor women. And now they're more or less happy
because I promised to help them. The Princess told them I had influence
with you. If she only knew!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You should never have been put in such a position. It was grossly
unfair. I'll take care that nothing of the sort occurs again.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>D'you mean to say you'll do nothing? Won't you even go into the matter
again&mdash;with a little sympathy?<a name="page_071" id="page_071"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I can't!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It's the first thing I've ever asked you, Arthur.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I know. I'm only sorry that I must refuse you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>This is the first sentence of death in Egypt since our marriage. Don't
you know what it would mean to me to think I'd saved a man's life? The
Khedive is waiting to sign the reprieve. It only requires a word from
you. Won't you say it? I feel that the gratitude of these poor women may
be like a blessing on us.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>My dear, I think my duty is very clear. I must do it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It's clear because all that grief means nothing to you. What do you care
if a man is hanged whom you've never even seen? I wonder if you'd find
it so easy to do your duty in a matter that affected you. If it meant
misery or happiness to you. It's easy to do one's duty when one doesn't
care.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You're quite right. That is the test: if one can do one's duty when it
means the loss of all one holds dear and valuable in the world.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I hope you'll never be put to it.<a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] My dear, you say that as though you hoped precisely
the contrary.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Must I write to the Princess and say I was entirely mistaken, and I have
no more influence over you than a tripper at Shepheard's Hotel?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I'd sooner you didn't write to her at all. I will have a message
conveyed which you may be sure will save you from any humiliation.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Icily.</i>] I'm afraid you have a lot of business; you mustn't let me
keep you.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He looks at her reflectively for a moment and then goes out.
There is an awkward silence.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Those good people we had to luncheon to-day would be amused to see what
the power amounts to that they congratulated me on.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>There's very little that Arthur would refuse you. He'd do practically
anything in the world to please you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It'll be a long time before I ask him to do anything else.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Don't say that, Violet. Because I came here to-day on purpose to ask you
to use your influence with him.<a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You see how much I have.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>That was a matter of principle. Men are always funny about principles.
You can never get them to understand that circumstances alter cases.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Arthur looks upon me as a child. After all, it's not my fault that I'm
twenty years younger than he is.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I want your help so badly, Violet. And you know, the fact that Arthur

make him anxious to do anything you ask now.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I don't want to expose myself to the humiliation of another refusal.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>It's so important to me. It may mean all the difference to Henry's
future.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a change of manner, charmingly.</i>] Oh! I'd love to do anything I
could for Henry.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>The Khedive has asked Arthur for an English secretary. It seems to me
that Henry has every possible qualification, but you know what Arthur
is; he's terrified of the least suspicion of favouring his friends and
relations.<a name="page_074" id="page_074"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>My dear Christina, what can I do? Arthur would merely tell me to mind my
own business.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>He wants to give the post to Ronald Parry....</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quickly.</i>] Ronny? But Ronny's going to Paris. It's all arranged.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>It was. But Arthur thinks it essential that he should stay in Egypt.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Did you know this, Anne?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Not till just now.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Does Ronny know?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I don't think so.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Violet</span> <i>is aghast. She does all she can to hide her agitation. The

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I'm ... I'm awfully surprised. It's only an hour or two ago that Ronny
and I bade one another a pathetic farewell.<a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Really? But there was never any talk of his going till the day after
to-morrow. You were in a great hurry with your leave-takings.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I thought he'd be busy packing and that I mightn't have another chance.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>You've been so intimate, I'm sure he would have been able to snatch a
moment to say good-bye to you and Arthur before his train started.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Violet</span> <i>does not quite know what this speech means. She gives</i>
<span class="smcap">Christina</span> <i>a look</i>. <span class="smcap">Anne</span> <i>comes to the rescue quickly</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Ronny has been acting as Violet's secretary to a certain extent. I
expect they had all sorts of little secrets together that they wanted to
discuss in private.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Of course. That's very natural. [<i>With great friendliness.</i>] If I
thought I were robbing you of anyone who was indispensable to you I
wouldn't ask you to put in a good word for Henry. But, of course, if
Ronald became the Khedive's secretary he couldn't exactly continue to
write letters and pay bills for you, could he?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I'm rather taken aback. I'd got it fixed in my head that Ronny was
going.<a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I can promise you that in helping Henry you're not doing any harm to
Ronald. Anne is very anxious that he should leave Egypt. Isn't that so?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>In a way. Henry is proposing to spend the rest of his official life in
Egypt. An appointment like this is naturally more important to him than
it would be to Ronny, who is by way of being a bird of passage.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Exactly. Ronny has had his experience here. If he stayed longer it would
only be waste of time. Anne naturally wants to have him near her. I
daresay she's a little afraid of his getting into mischief here.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I don't know about that, Christina.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>My dear, you know how susceptible he is. There's always the possibility
that he'll fall in love with someone who isn't very desirable.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I've got an awful headache.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Why don't you take a little aspirin? I'm quite sure that if you set your
mind to it you can persuade Arthur to give the job to Henry. And that
would settle everything.<a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>And if I can't persuade him?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Then you must put it to Ronny.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>You see, if he refused the appointment and left Egypt, then I'm
convinced Arthur would accept Henry.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Why should I put it to Ronny?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pleasantly.</i>] You've been so very friendly, haven't you? If you
suggested to him that ... he's standing in Henry's way....</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I should have thought it was for Anne to do that.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

he won't do for his sister.</p>

<p>Isn't it magnificent?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>You're very changeable. It's only a few months ago that you were
constantly telling Henry you'd had enough of the country.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>Never. I love it. I should like to stay here all my life.</p>

<p>Fancy that!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Addressing himself to</i> <span class="smcap">Violet</span>.] It would be madness to leave a place

It's a wonderful country. One lives every minute of the day.</p>

<p>You're so enthusiastic. One would almost think you'd fallen in love.</p>

<p>Won't you tell us who with?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] I was only joking. Isn't it enough to have a
splendid job in a country where there's so much hope? Sir Arthur has
given me a marvellous opportunity. It'll be my fault if I don't make the
most of it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Dryly.</i>] Shall I give you a cup of tea?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Chaffing her.</i>] D'you think I want calming down? I feel like a
prisoner who was going to be hanged and has just had a free pardon. I
don't want to be calmed down. I want to revel in my freedom.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>It's no good trying to snub me. I'm unsnubable to-day. You haven't

<p>I've always been given to understand that aunts give their nephews ten

<p>Do they? I am glad. I'd love to press ten shillings into your willing

<p>Halloa, Ronny. Lucky devil. I congratulate you.</p>

<p>On what? Christina!<a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a></p>

<p>I told Henry. I didn't think it would matter, I thought it better that
he should know.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Henry.</span></p>

<p>I say, Uncle Arthur, I'm afraid mother has been giving you a rotten
time. It's not my fault, you know.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>What isn't?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Henry.</span></p>

<p>Well, when mother told me at luncheon that the Khedive had applied for
an English secretary, I saw by the beady look in her eye that if I
didn't get the job she was going to make things unpleasant for somebody.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Really, Henry, I don't know what you mean.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Henry.</span></p>

<p>Well, mother, you're an old dear....</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Not so old either.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Certainly not, Henry. Let us have none of your nonsense.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Henry.</span></p>

<p>But you know perfectly well that you'd cheerfully bring the British
Empire tumbling about our ears if you could get me a good fat billet by

<p>You've got no right to say that, Henry. I've never asked anything for
you that it wasn't practically your right to have.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Henry.</span></p>

<p>Well, mother, between you and me I don't mind telling you that Ronny is
much more suited to this particular job than I am. Only a perfect fool
would have hesitated, and for the honour of the family we can't suspect
Uncle Arthur of being that.</p>

him a decent fellow in spite of yourself.</p>

you. I want to know that I'm close to you. I want to touch your hand. I
want to think of you. What harm can that do you?<a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>If I were my own mistress I could laugh and let you do as you choose.
But I'm not. I'm bound to you hand and foot. It's torture to me. And the
worst of it is I love my bonds. I can't wish to be without them. I'm at
your mercy, Ronny. I love you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>Oh, but that's enough for me. I swear to you I don't want you to do
anything that you'll ever regret.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>If it could only be taken out of our hands. If something would only
happen.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>What can happen?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps the Khedive will change his mind. Perhaps the Foreign Office
will say you must go to Paris.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>Would you be pleased? Violet, I want so little from you. How can it hurt
you to give me that? Let us give ourselves a chance to be happy.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>We shall never be happy. Never. The only thing we can do is to part, and
I can't let you go. I can't. I can't. It's asking too much of me.<a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a></p>

<p>What have you to see the Khedive about&mdash;if it isn't a secret?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Not at all. I'm merely going to place before him Ronny's name.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Then the matter's not definitely settled yet?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Not formally. I've not had the reply yet to my telegram to the Foreign
Office, and I've not had the Khedive's acceptance of my suggestion.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>But supposing the Foreign Office say they think he'd better go to Paris
after all?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I think it's most unlikely. They know by now that the man on the spot is
the best judge of the circumstances, and I've accustomed them to giving
me a free hand.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>And you think the Khedive will raise no objection?<a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a></p>

<p>I made myself needlessly disagreeable. Will you forgive me?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Darling, don't reproach yourself. That's more than I can bear. There's
nothing to forgive.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I owe so much to you. I hate to think that I was horrid.</p>

<p>Let us hope she will bear her disappointment with as much fortitude as I
do.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I don't think she's entirely given up hope that you will change your

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] I'm sure of that. I don't expect to have much peace

quickly.<a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>What is your objection to Henry?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>None. He's not such a good man as Ronald Parry, that's all.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>The last time there was a good job going Henry just missed getting it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Henry is one of those men who would do very well for a job if there
weren't always somebody just a little bit better applying at the same
time.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Christina thinks you're so anxious not to favour him because he's your
nephew that you are positively biassed against him.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Christina, like the majority of her sex, has an unerring eye for the
discreditable motive.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>She blames me because you won't help Henry. She thinks it's because I'm
jealous of her.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>How exactly like her! The best mother and the most unreasonable woman
I've ever known.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Forcing the words out.</i>] It would be a great pleasure to me if you
could change your mind and let Henry have the post instead of Ronald
Parry.<a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, don't ask me to do that. You know how I hate refusing to do
anything you wish.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Anne is so anxious that Ronny should go to Paris. He's made all his
preparations, don't you think you might just as well let him go?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid I don't. I want him here.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It would be such a joy to me if I could go and tell Christina that you'd
consented. It would make such a difference to me, you see. I want her to
be fond of me, and I know she'd never forget if I'd been able to do her
a good turn like that. Oh, Arthur, won't you?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Darling, I'm afraid I can't.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I promise I'll never ask you anything again as long as I live if you'll
only do this for me. It means so much to me. You don't know how much.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I can't, Violet.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Won't you talk it over with Anne?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>To tell you the truth I don't think it's any business of hers.<a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hesitatingly.</i>] Is it due to her influence that Ronald was appointed
to Paris?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I want to know. If she's been pulling strings to get him moved I suppose
it's for some reason. He was very comfortable here. It's not often you
find a secretary who exactly suits you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Well, yes, it was her doing. She tells me she doesn't mean to come to
Egypt so much as in the past and wants her brother nearer to her.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>If she wants to see much of her brother she let him choose rather an
unfortunate profession.... I wonder she didn't tell you the truth.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quickly.</i>] I'm convinced she did. I thought her explanation very
natural. I'm sorry it's necessary for me to interfere with her plans.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I'm sure she wouldn't mind my telling you why she's so anxious Ronny
should leave Egypt. She thinks he's in love with a married woman and it
seems desirable to get him away. Perhaps she didn't want to tell you. I
fancy she's been very uneasy about it.<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I daresay it's only a momentary infatuation. Let us hope he will get
over it quickly. I can't lose a useful public servant because he happens
to have formed an unfortunate attachment.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid I'm not explaining myself very well. Ronny is desperately in
love. There's no other way of putting it. You <i>must</i> let him go. After
all, you're very fond of him, you've known him since he was a small boy;
it isn't as though he were a stray young man sent you by the Foreign
Office. You can't be entirely indifferent to him. Perhaps his welfare is
at stake. Don't you think it's wiser&mdash;it's only kind&mdash;to send him out of
harm's way.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>My dear, you know that I&mdash;Arthur Little&mdash;would do anything to please you
and that I care very much for the happiness of Anne and the welfare of
Ronald Parry. But, you see, I'm an official too, and the official can't
do all sorts of things that the man would be very glad to.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>How can you separate the official and the man? The official can't do
things that the man disapproves.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Ah! that's a point that has been discussed ever since states came into
being. Are the rules of private morality binding on the statesman? In
theory most of us answer yes, but in practice very few act<a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a> on that
principle. In this case, darling, it hardly applies. I see no conflict
between the man and the official.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You think it doesn't really concern you, Arthur?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I've not said that. But I'm not going to let an appeal to my emotions
interfere with my judgment. I think I understand the situation. I'm not
proposing to change my mind. I shall present Ronny's name to the Khedive
to-morrow.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>D'you think me very stupid, Arthur?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Not at all, darling. Only a clever woman could achieve your beauty.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Then doesn't it occur to you that if I've made such a point of Ronny's
going it must be for some very good reason?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a quick look at her.</i>] Don't you think we'd better leave that
subject alone, darling?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid you'll think it silly and vain of me to say so, but I think
you should know that&mdash;that Ronny's in love with me. That is why I want
him to go.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It's very natural that he should be in love with you. I'm always
surprised that everybody else isn't. I<a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a> don't see how I can prevent that
except by taking you to live in the depths of the Sahara.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Don't make light of it, Arthur. It wasn't very easy for me to tell you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>How do you wish me to take it? I can't blame Ronald. He's by way of
being a gentleman. I've been good to him. He'll make the best of a bad
job.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>D'you mean to say that it makes no difference to you?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>This secretaryship is a stepping-stone to a very important position.
You're not going to ask me to rob him of it because he's done something
so very natural as to fall in love with the most charming woman in
Egypt? I imagine that all my secretaries will fall in love with you.
Poor devils, I don't see how they can be expected to help it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You drive me mad. It's so serious, it's so tremendously serious, and you
have the heart to make little jokes about it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gravely.</i>] Has it ever struck you that flippancy is often the best way
of dealing with a serious situation? Sometimes it's really too serious
to be taken seriously.<a name="page_000" id="page_000"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean by that?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Nothing very much. I was excusing myself for my ill-timed jests.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You're determined to keep Ronny here?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Quite. [<i>There is a pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> <i>gets up and puts his hand on her

forgive me I will get back to the office.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>No, don't go yet, Arthur. There's something more I want to say to you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Will you allow me to advise you not to? It's so easy to say too much;
it's never unwise to say too little. I beseech you not to say anything
that we should both of us regret.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You think it's unimportant if Ronny loves me, because you trust me
implicitly.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Implicitly.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Has it never occurred to you that I might be influenced by his love
against my will? Do you think it's so very safe?<a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>If I allowed any doubt on that matter to enter my head I should surely
be quite unworthy of your affection.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Arthur, I don't want to have any secrets from you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I must now.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, don't you see that things said can never be taken back. We
may both know something....</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] What do you mean?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>But so long as we don't tell one another we can ignore it. If certain
words pass our lips then the situation is entirely changed.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You're frightening me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I don't wish to do that. Only you can tell me nothing that I don't know.
But if you tell me you may do irreparable harm.<a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>D'you mean to say you know? Oh, it's impossible. Arthur, Arthur, I can't
help it. I must tell you. It burns my heart. I love Ronny with all my
body and soul.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>There is a pause while they look at one another.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Did you think I didn't know?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Then why did you offer him the job?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I had to.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>No one could have blamed you if you had suggested Henry.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>My dear, I'm paid a very considerable salary. It would surely be taking
money under false pretences if I didn't do my work to the best of my
ability.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It may mean happiness or misery to all three of us.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I must take the risk of that. You see, Ronny is cut out for this
particular position. It's only common honesty to give it him.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Don't you love me any more?<a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Don't ask me that, Violet. You know I love you with all my heart.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Then I can't understand.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You don't think I want him to stay, do you? When the telegram came from
the Foreign Office ordering him to Paris my middle-aged heart simply
leapt for joy. Do you think I didn't see all the advantages he had over
me? He seemed to have so much to offer you and I so little.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Arthur!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>But if he went away I thought presently you'd forget him. I thought if I
were very kind to you and tolerant, and if I asked nothing more from you
than you were prepared to give I might in time make you feel towards me,
not love perhaps, but tenderness and affection. That was all I could
hope for, but that would have made me very happy. Then the Khedive asked
for an English secretary, and I knew Ronny was the only man for it. You
see, I've been at this work so long, the official in me makes decisions
almost mechanically.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>And supposing they break the heart of the man in you?<a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] By a merciful interposition of Providence we all seem to
have just enough strength to bear the burdens that are placed on us.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Why didn't you do something?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Will you tell me what there was to do?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Aren't you angry with us?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I should be a fool to be that. It seems to me so natural, so horribly
natural. He's young and nice-looking and cheery. It seems to me now
inevitable that you should have fallen in love with him. You might be
made for one another.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, do you see that?<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It had struck you too, had it? I suppose it's obvious to anyone who
takes the trouble to think about it. [<i>She does not answer.</i>] Haven't
you wished with all your heart that you'd met him first? Don't you hate
me now because I married you? [<i>She looks away.</i>] My dear child, I'm so
sorry for you. I've been very grateful for your kindness to me during
the last month or two. I've seen you try to be loving to me and
affectionate. I've been so anxious to tell you not to force yourself,
because I understood and you mustn't be unhappy about me. But I didn't
know how. I could only make myself as little troublesome as possible.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You've been immensely good to me, Arthur.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>That's the least you had a right to expect of me. I did you a great
wrong in marrying you. I knew you didn't love me. You were dazzled by
the circumstances. You didn't know what marriage was and how irksome it
must be unless love makes its constraints sweeter than freedom. But I
adored you. I thought love would come. With all my heart I ask you to
forgive me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Arthur, don't talk like that. You know I was so happy to marry you.
I thought you wonderful, I was so excited and flattered&mdash;I thought that
was love. I never knew that love would come like this.<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a> If I'd only
known what to expect I could have fought against it. It took me
unawares. I never had a chance. It wasn't my fault, Arthur.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I'm not blaming you, darling.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It would be easier for me if you did.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It's just bad luck. Bad luck? I might have expected it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Still, I'm glad I've told you. I hated having a secret from you. It's
better that we should be frank with one another.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>If I can help you in any way I'm glad too that you've told me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>What is to be done?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>There's nothing to be done.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Arthur, until to-day Ronny and I have never exchanged a word that anyone
might not have heard. I was happy to be with him, I knew he liked me, I
was quite satisfied with that. But when I heard that he was going away
suddenly everything was changed. I felt I couldn't bear to let him go.
Oh, I'm so ashamed, Arthur.<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Dear child!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I don't know how it happened. He told me he loved me. He didn't mean to.
Don't think he's been disloyal to you, Arthur. We were both so upset. It
was just as much my fault as his. I couldn't help letting him see how
much he meant to me. We thought we were never going to see one another
again. He took me in his arms and held me in them. I was so happy and so
miserable. I never thought life could mean so much.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>And just now when you were alone he kissed your hands.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>How do you know?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>When I wanted to kiss them you withdrew them. You couldn't bear that I
should touch them. You felt on them still the pressure of his lips.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I couldn't help it. He was beside himself with joy because he needn't
go. I don't want to love him, Arthur. I want to love you. I've tried so
desperately hard.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>My dear, one either loves or one doesn't. I'm afraid trying doesn't do
much good.<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>If he stays here I shall have to see him constantly. I shan't have a
chance to get over it. Oh, I can't. I can't. It's intolerable. Have pity
on me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid you'll be very unhappy. But you see, something more than your
happiness is at stake. A little while ago you said you wanted to do more
for your country than you did. Does it strike you that you can do
something for it now?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>We all want to do great and heroic things, but generally we can only do
very modest ones. D'you think we ought to shirk them?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I don't understand.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Ronny can be of infinite value here. You can't help your feelings for
him. I can't bring myself to blame you. But you are mistress of your
words and your actions. What are we to do? You wouldn't wish me to
resign when my work here is but half done. We must make the best of the
position. Remember that all of us here, you more than most women,
because you're my wife, work for the common cause by our lives and the
example we set. At all costs we must seem honest, straightforward, and
without reproach. And one finds by experience that it's much less
trouble to be a thing than only to<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a> seem it. There's only one way in
which we can avoid reproach and that is by being irreproachable.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You mean that it's necessary for the country that Ronny and you should
stay here? And if my heart breaks it doesn't matter. I thought I was
doing so much in asking you to send him away. Don't you know that with
all my heart I wanted him to stay? D'you know what I feel, Arthur? I
can't think of anything else. I'm obsessed by a hungry longing for him.
Till to-day I could have borne it. But now ... I feel his arms about me
every moment, and his kisses on my lips. You can't know the rapture and
the torture and the ecstasy that consume me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, do you think I don't know what love is?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I want to do the right thing, Arthur, but you mustn't ask too much of
me. If I've got to treat him as a casual friend, I can't go on seeing
him. I can't, Arthur, I can't! If he must stay then let me go.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Never! I think, even if it weren't necessary, I should make him stay
now. You and I are not people to run away from danger. After all, we're
not obliged to yield to our passions&mdash;we can control them if we want to.
For your own sake you must stay, Violet.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>And if I break, I break.<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It's only the worthless who are broken by unhappiness. If you have faith
and courage and honesty unhappiness can only make you stronger.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Have you thought of yourself, Arthur? What will you feel when you see
him with me? What will you suspect when you're working in your office
and don't know where I am?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I shall know that you are unhappy, and I shall feel the most tender
compassion for you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You're exposing me to a temptation that I want with all my heart to
yield to. What is there to hold me back? Only the thought that I must do
my duty to you. What is there to reward me? Only the idea that perhaps
I'm doing a little something for the country.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I put myself in your hands, Violet. I shall never suspect that you can
do anything, not that I should reproach you for&mdash;I will never reproach
you&mdash;but that you may reproach yourself for.</p>

<p>[<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Just now, when we were talking of Abdul Said, I asked if you could do
your duty when it was a matter that affected you, if it meant misery or
happiness to you, I said.<a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>My dear, duty is rather a forbidding word. Let us say that I&mdash;want to
earn my screw.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You must have thought me very silly. I said I hoped you'd never be put
to the test, and the test had come already, and you never hesitated.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>These things are very much a matter of habit, you know.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>What you can do I can do too, Arthur&mdash;if you believe in me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Of course I believe in you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Then let him stay. I'll do what I can.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Ronny</span> <i>comes in</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>The Khedive was engaged when I rang up. But I left the message and the
answer has just come through. He will be pleased to see you, sir, at
eleven o'clock.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>That will do admirably. Ronny must lunch with us to-morrow, Violet.
We'll crack a bottle to celebrate his step!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Well, my dear, I think it's about time I was taking you back to your
hotel.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Oh, nonsense! It's when everybody has gone that a dance really begins to
get amusing.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>That's a pleasant remark to make to your guests.<a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I'm really ashamed to have stayed like this to the bitter end, but I do
love to see the young folk enjoying themselves.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Ah! you have learnt how to make the most of advancing years. The solace
of old age is to take pleasure in the youth of those who come after us.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I don't think you're very polite, Arthur.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Bless your heart, I know I'm not so young as I was.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Do you mind?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Me? Why should I? I've had my day and I've enjoyed it. It's only fair to
give others a chance now.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I'm sure you enjoyed your trip up the Nile.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Oh, we had a wonderful time.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>And what conclusions did you come to, Mr. Appleby? I remember that you
were looking for instruction as well as amusement.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I didn't forget what you told me. I just kept my ears open and my mouth
shut.<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>A capital practice, not much favoured by democratic communities.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>But I came to one very definite conclusion for all that.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>What was it?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>In fact, I came to two.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>That's not so satisfactory&mdash;unless they contradicted one another; in
which case I venture to suggest that you have grasped at all events the
elements of the Egyptian problem.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>The first is that you're the right man in the right place.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Christina would never admit that. She has known for many years that she
could manage Egypt far better than I do.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>I don't deny that for a minute. I think on the whole women are more
level-headed than men. They're not swayed by emotion. They're more
practical. They know that principle must often yield to expediency, and
they can do the expedient without surrendering the principle.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You make my head whirl, Christina.<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I had the opportunity of seeing a good many different sorts of people. I
never heard a reasonable complaint against you. Some of them didn't like
you personally, but they looked up to you, and they believed in you. I
asked myself how you managed it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I told him that it's because you're human.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Christina thinks it very bad for me to hear pleasant things said of me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p>Christina doesn't know what her brother would do if he hadn't got an
affectionate sister to gibe at.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>It must be a great satisfaction to you to see the country becoming every
year more prosperous and contented.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>What was the second conclusion you came to?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I'm coming to that. Most of us are torn asunder as it were by a conflict
of duties. This and that urgently needs to be done, and if you put one
thing right you put something else wrong. We all want to do for the
best, but we don't exactly know what the best is. Now, you've got your
duty clearly marked out before you, if you take my meaning; you're
young.<a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Youngish.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>You've made a success of your job and of your life. It's not all of us
who can say that. My second conclusion is that you must be the happiest
man alive.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I'm glad he's got that off his chest. He's been dinning it into my ears
for the last ten days. My impression is that he fell in love with Lady
Little that day he lunched here six weeks ago.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I'm not going to blame him for that. Everybody does.... It was a wise
old fellow who said that you must count no man happy till he's dead.
[<span class="smcap">Christina</span> <i>gives him a look, and puts her hand affectionately on his

<p>When are you going to send that unfortunate band away?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, we must have one more dance. After all, it's our last ball of the
season. And now that everyone has gone I needn't be dignified any more.
There's no one but Henry and Anne and Ronny. We've just had a gorgeous
one-step, haven't we, Henry?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Henry.</span></p>

<p>Gorgeous. You're a ripping dancer.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>My one accomplishment. [<i>The band is heard beginning a waltz.</i>] Good
heavens, they've started again. That's Anne, I'm positive. She's been
playing the British matron too and now she's having her fling.</p>

<p>We've never talked about it. [<i>Giving him her hand.</i>] I want to thank
you for having been so good to me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid you haven't got much to thank me for. It would have been
easier if I'd been able to help you, but I didn't see anything I could
do but just sit still and twiddle my thumbs.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I've felt your confidence in me and that has been a help. You've never
given the slightest sign that anything was changed. You used sometimes
to ask me what I'd been doing during the day. Of late you haven't even
done that.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I didn't want you to suspect for a moment that your actions were not
perfectly free.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I know. No one could have been more considerate than you've been. Oh,
I've been so unhappy, Arthur. I wouldn't go through the last six weeks
for anything in the world.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It's torn my heart to see you so pale and wan. And when, often, I saw
you'd been crying I almost lost my head. I didn't know what to do.<a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I couldn't help it if I loved him, Arthur. That wasn't in my power. But
all that was in my power I've done. Somehow I've managed not to be alone
with him.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Haven't you had any explanation with him?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>There didn't seem to be anything to explain. D'you think I ought to have
told him I didn't love him? I couldn't, Arthur. I couldn't.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>My dear! My dear!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Once or twice he wrote to me. I knew he would and I'd made up my mind
not to read the letters. But when they came I couldn't help myself. I
had to read them. I was so wretched and it meant so much to me that he
loved me. [<span class="smcap">Arthur</span> <i>makes an instinctive movement of pain</i>.] I didn't
mean to say that. Please forgive me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I think I understand.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I didn't answer them.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Did he only write once or twice?<a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>That's all. You see, he can't make it out. He thinks I've treated him
badly. Oh, I think that's the hardest thing of all. I've seen the misery
in his eyes. And there was nothing I could do. I hadn't the courage to
tell him. I'm weak. I'm so horribly weak. And when I'm with him alone
I.... Oh, it is cruel that I should make him suffer so when he loves me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I don't know what to say to you. It seems cold comfort to say that you
must set your hope in the merciful effects of time. Time will ease your
pain and his. Perhaps the worst is over already.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I hope with all my heart it is. I couldn't have borne any more, Arthur.
I'm at the end of my strength.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Dear heart, you're tired physically now. We'll send these people away
and you must go to bed.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Yes. I'm exhausted. But I want to tell you, Arthur, I think you're
right. The worst is over. I'm not suffering quite so much as I did. I
find it a little easier not to think of him. When I meet him I can
manage to be gay and flippant and indifferent. I'm so glad, Arthur.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You've been very brave. I told you we were all strong enough to bear the
burdens that are laid upon us.<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You mustn't think too well of me. I couldn't have done what I have
except for the consciousness of his great love for me. Is that awfully
disloyal of me, Arthur?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gravely.</i>] No, darling.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You can understand, can't you? It means so much to me. It's helped me
more than anything else in the world. It's the only thing that made
these past weeks not intolerable. I'm satisfied to know he loves me. I
want nothing more.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Henry.</span></p>

<p>First rate. Only mother won't let herself go. I kept on telling her

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Christina.</span></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>No. He came rather late and my card was filled up. I promised him an

I gave him Ronny's.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Appleby.</span></p>

<p>There were two or three dances at our hotel last week and we saw him

I wonder if you know her?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>No, I don't think so. We get to know very few of the winter visitors.<a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a></p>

<p>She's a perfect picture to look at. And a beautiful dancer.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>Everyone was looking at them last night. They made a wonderful pair.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Do you know this lady, Henry?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Henry.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I've met her two or three times. She's very pretty.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>I don't think anyone else had much of a look in with her.</p>

<p>Well, you needn't be disagreeable about it.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Appleby.</span></p>

<p>And now he's surprised and pleased. I've met her. Poor dear, she did
everything to make me like her, because Ronny was my brother. She's
awfully pretty. He's not in love with her yet. But I think he may be.
He's on the brink and if there were nothing else he'd fall over.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>That is what I suspected. You know, Anne, the longer I live the more
inexplicable I find human beings. I always thought I was by way of being
a fairly decent fellow. I never knew what mean beastliness there was
inside me. It would be quite impossible for me to tell you how I hate
your brother. I've had to be jolly and affable with him and, by George,
I wanted to kill him.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Why didn't you let him go? Are you sure it was necessary to give him
that job?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Already he's been invaluable.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Then one can only hope for the best.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>There is a moment's pause. When</i> <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> <i>speaks it is at first
rather to himself than to</i> <span class="smcap">Anne</span>.]</p></div>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>No one knows what I've gone through during the last few months. I've
been devoured with jealousy and I knew it would be fatal if I showed
Violet the<a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a> least trace of ill-temper. I kept on saying to myself that
it wasn't her fault if she was in love with Ronny. [<i>Humorously.</i>] You
can't think how devilish hard it is not to resent the fact that somebody
doesn't care for you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] Oh yes, I can.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I knew that almost everything depended on how I acted during these
weeks, and the maddening thing was that I could do nothing but sit still
and control myself. I saw her miserable and knew that she didn't want my
comfort. I've yearned to take her in my arms and I've known she'd <i>let</i>
me because it was her duty. Those dear good donkeys, the Applebys, told
me just now they thought I must be the happiest man alive! Week after
week, with an aching heart I've forced myself to be gay and amusing.
D'you think I'm amusing, Anne?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Sometimes.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>The battle has been so unfair. All the dice are loaded against me. He
has every advantage over me. But at last I thought I'd won. I thought
Violet was getting more resigned. She told me herself just now that the
worst was over. And those confounded people must go and upset the
applecart. Damn their eyes!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Why?<a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>The Applebys told her about Miss Pender. It was very natural. They knew
no reason for not repeating the hotel gossip.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Was that why she asked Ronny to dance with her?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Yes. It's the crisis. She had the strength to keep him at arm's length
when she knew he loved her. What will she do now?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>You heard what Henry said. They don't seem to be talking to one another.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Why did you let them dance together? You might easily have said it was
too late and the band must go.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>What good would that do? No. I've done nothing to prevent their meeting.
I've left them absolute liberty.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Do you think it's fair to Violet? You know, women act so much on
impulse. The surroundings and the circumstances have so much influence
on them. Think of the excitement of dancing, the magic of this wonderful
night, and the solitude under these stars.<a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a> You complain the dice are
loaded against you, but now you're double-loading them against yourself.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It tortures me, but I must give them the opportunity to fight the matter
out for themselves.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Poor child, she's so young.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Too young.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Don't say that; it sounds as though you regretted having married her.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Don't you imagine that regret has been tormenting her ever since she
found out what love really was? Even though I love her with all my heart
I know now that I made a mistake. Do you think you can make anyone love
you by constant tenderness, devotion, and kindness?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Not a man perhaps. But a woman yes, yes, yes!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Whoever loved that loved not at first sight? I want so tremendously to
make her happy, and I've only made her utterly miserable. And there's no
way out. It's a pity that a convenient attack of brain fever can't carry
me off, but I'm as strong as a horse.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>You know, Arthur, there's one compensation about the pains of love.
While one's suffering from<a name="page_139" id="page_139"></a> them one feels one will never get over them,
but one does, and when they're gone they don't even leave a scar. One
looks back and remembers one's torment and marvels that it was possible
to suffer like that.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You talk as though you'd had experience.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I have.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I always look upon you as so calm and self-controlled.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I was desperately in love for years with a man. I should have made him
an excellent wife, although it's I as says it. But it never occurred to
him for an instant that my feelings were more than friendly. And
eventually he married somebody else.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>My dear friend, I hate to think of your being unhappy.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I'm not. That's why I told you the tragic story. I've got over it so
completely that now I have an equal affection both for him and his wife.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>D'you know, Anne, at one time I very nearly asked you to marry me?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gaily.</i>] Oh, what nonsense!<a name="page_140" id="page_140"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I daresay it's as well I didn't. I should have lost the best friend I've
ever had.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, I've lost the satisfaction of refusing the most
distinguished man of our day. Why didn't you ask me?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You were such an awfully good friend. I thought we were very well as we
were.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>That isn't the reason, Arthur. You didn't ask me because you didn't love
me. If you had you'd have let friendship go hang. [<i>Seeing that he is
not paying any attention to her.</i>] What's the matter?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>The music has stopped.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a slight tightening of the lips.</i>] I'm afraid my concerns don't
interest you very much. I was only talking about them to distract you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Forgive me, but I've got this anguish gnawing at my heart. Anne, when
they come back here I want you to come with me for a stroll in the
garden.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Why? I'm frightfully tired. I think I shall go to bed.<a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>No, do this for me, Anne. I want to give them their chance. It may be
the last chance for all of us.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little sigh.</i>] Very well, I'll do even that for you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You are a good friend, and I'm a selfish beast.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I wish you could have a child, Arthur. That might settle everything.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>That is what I look forward to with all my heart. I think she might love
her baby's father.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Then she'll realise that only you could have been so tolerant and so
immensely patient. When she looks back she'll be filled with gratitude.</p>

<p>I've told the band they can go.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I don't suppose they wanted telling twice. Did you have a pleasant
dance?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I was very tired.<a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>It was brutal of me to make you dance so long. I'll say good-night
before I'm turned out.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Oh, won't you sit down and have a cigarette before you go? Anne and I
were just going to stroll to the end of the garden to have a look at the
Nile.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>What was it that Christina was referring to just now? Had it anything to

<p>I don't think I'm justified in telling you about it. If Sir Arthur

<p>Of course you mustn't tell me if it's a secret.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>I'd almost forgotten what a beautiful dancer you were.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] So soon?<a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>You haven't given me much chance of dancing with you during the last few
weeks.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I hear there's a girl at the Ghezireh Palace who dances very well. Miss
Pender, isn't that her name?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>Yes, she's wonderful.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I'm told she's charming.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>Very.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I should like to meet her. I wonder whom I know that could bring us
together.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a change of tone.</i>] Why do you speak of her?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Is there any reason why I shouldn't?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>Do you know that this is the first time I've been quite alone with you
for six weeks?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Still quite lightly.</i>] It was inevitable that when you ceased being
Arthur's private secretary we should see less of one another.<a name="page_144" id="page_144"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>I only welcomed my new job because I thought I shouldn't be utterly
parted from you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Don't you think it was better that we shouldn't see too much of one
another?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>What have I done to you, Violet? Why have you been treating me like
this?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I'm not conscious that I've treated you differently from what I used.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>Why didn't you answer my letters?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a low voice.</i>] I hadn't anything to say.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>I wonder if you can imagine what I went through, the eagerness with
which I looked forward to a letter from you, just a word or two would
have satisfied me, how anxiously I expected each post, and my despair
when day after day went by.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You ought not to have written to me.<a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>D'you think I could help myself? Have you forgotten that day when we
thought we were never going to meet again? If you wanted me to be
nothing more than a friend why did you tell me you loved me? Why did you
let me kiss you and hold you in my arms?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You know quite well. I lost my head. I was foolish. You&mdash;you attached
too much importance to the emotion of the moment.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Violet, how can you say that? I know you loved me then. After all,
the past can't be undone. I loved you. I know you loved me. We couldn't
go back to the time when we were no more than friends.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>You forget that Arthur is my husband and you owe him everything in the
world. We both owe him everything in the world.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>No, I don't forget it for a moment. After all, we're straight, both of
us, and we could have trusted ourselves. I wanted nothing but to be
allowed to love you and to know that you loved me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Do you remember what you said in the first letter you wrote me?<a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>Oh, you can't blame me for that. I'd loved you so long, so passionately.
I'd never dared to hope that you cared for me. And when I knew! I never
said a tenth part of what I wanted to. I went home and I just wrote all
that had filled my heart to overflowing. I wanted you to know how humbly
grateful I was for the wonderful happiness you'd given me. I wanted you
to know that my soul to its most hidden corners was yours for ever.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>How <i>could</i> I answer it?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>You needn't have been afraid of me, Violet. If it displeased you I would
never even have told you that I loved you. I would have carried you in
my heart like an image of the Blessed Virgin. When we met here or there,
though there were a thousand people between us and we never exchanged a
word, I should have known that we were the only people in the world, and
that somehow, in some strange mystic fashion, I belonged to you and you
belonged to me. Oh, Violet, I only wanted a little kindness. Was it so
much to ask?</p>

<p>Perhaps it is.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Ronny.</span></p>

<p>She plays tennis a good deal and she's very fond of dancing. You know, I
was rather wretched. Sometimes you looked at me as though you hated me.
You seemed to try and avoid me. I wanted to forget. I didn't know what
I'd done to make you treat me so cruelly. It was very pleasant to be
with someone who seemed to want me. Everything I did pleased her. She's
rather like you. When I was with her I was a little less unhappy. When I
found she was in love with me I was touched and I was tremendously
grateful.</p>

that, aren't there? It goes just as suddenly as it comes. And when it
goes&mdash;well, it's gone for ever. I can't understand then what on earth I
saw in the man who made my heart go pit-a-pat. I'm dreadfully sorry I
caused you so much pain. You took it so much more seriously than I

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Where is Ronny?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>He's gone. It was so late. He asked me to say good-night to you.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Thank you. It must be very late. I'll say good-night too. [<i>She bends
down and kisses</i> <span class="smcap">Violet</span>.] Good-night, Arthur.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Good-night. [<i>She goes out.</i> <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> <i>sits down. A</i> <span class="smcap">Sais</span> <i>comes in and
turns out some of the lights. In the distance is heard the wailing of an

out myself. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Sais</span> <i>goes in and turns out all the lights in the
lower rooms but one. The light remains now only just round</i> <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Violet</span>. <i>The Arab song is like a wail of pain.</i>] That sounds strangely
after the waltzes and one-steps that we've heard this evening.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It seems to come from very far away.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It seems to wail down the ages from an immeasurable past.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>What does it say?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I don't know. It must be some old lament.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It's heartrending.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Now it stops.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>The garden is so silent. It seems to be listening too.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Are you awfully unhappy, Violet?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Awfully.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>It breaks my heart that I, who would do anything in the world for you,
can do so little to console you.<a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a></p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Had you any idea that Ronny no longer cared for me?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>How should I know what his feelings were?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>It never occurred to me that he could change. I felt so secure in his
love. It never occurred to me that anyone could take him from me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Did he tell you he didn't care for you any more?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I don't think he's in love with Miss Pender.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I told him that he meant nothing to me any more. I told him that I took
fancies and got over them. I made him think I was a silly flirt. And he
believed me. If he loved me truly, truly, as he did before, whatever I'd
said he'd have known it was incredible. Oh, I wouldn't have believed him
if he'd made himself cheap in my eyes.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>My poor child.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>He's not in love with her yet. I know that. He's only pleased and
flattered. He's angry with me. If he's angry he <i>must</i> love me still. He
asked so little.<a name="page_153" id="page_153"></a> It only needed a word and he would have loved me as
much as ever. What have I done? What harm would it have done you? I've
sent him away now for good. It's all over and done with. And my heart
aches. What shall I do, Arthur?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>My dear, have courage. I beseech you to have courage.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I suppose it's shameful that we should have loved one another at all.
But how could we help it? We're masters of our actions, but how can we
command our feelings? After all, our feelings are our own. I don't know
what I'm going to do, Arthur. It wasn't so bad till to-night; I could
control myself, I thought my pain was growing less.... I long for him
with all my soul, and I must let him go. Oh, I hate him. I hate him. If
he'd loved me he might have been faithful to me a few short weeks. He
wouldn't cause me such cruel pain.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Don't be unjust to him, Violet. I think he fell in love with you without
knowing what was happening to him. And when he knew I think he struggled
against it as honourably as you did. You know that very little escapes
me. I've seen a sort of shyness in him when he was with me, as though he
were a little ashamed in my presence. I even felt sorry for him because
he felt he was behaving badly to me and he couldn't help himself. He's
suffered just as much as you have. It's not very strange that when this
girl fell in love with him it should seem to offer a new hope. He was
unhappy and she comforted<a name="page_154" id="page_154"></a> him. Anne says she's rather like you. If ever
he loves her perhaps it will be you that he loves in her.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Why do you say all this to me?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You've been so wretched. I don't want bitterness to come to you now. I
can't bear that you should think your first love has been for someone
not worthy of it. I think time will heal the wounds which now you think
are incurable, but when it does I hope that you will look back on your
love as a thing only of beauty.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I am a beast, Arthur. I don't deserve anyone to be so good to me as you
are.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>And there's something else I must tell you.... It appears that various
enterprising people have been laying plans to put me out of the way.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Startled.</i>] Arthur!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>I find that there was a plot to kill me this morning on my way to the
review.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>How awful!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We've settled everything without
any fuss. Our old friend Osman Pasha is going to spend some time on his
country estates for the good of his health, and half<a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a> a dozen foolish
young men are under lock and key. But it might have come off except for
Ronny. It was Ronny who saved me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Ronny? Oh, I'm so glad. It makes up a little for the rest.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>He did a fine thing. He showed determination and presence of mind.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my husband! My dear, dear Arthur!</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You're not sorry?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I'm glad I've done what I have, Arthur. I've sometimes felt I gave you
so little in return for all you've given me. But at least now I've given
you all I had to give.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Don't think it will be profitless. To do one's duty sounds a rather cold
and cheerless business, but somehow in the end it does give one a queer
sort of satisfaction.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>What should I do if I lost you? It makes me sick with fear.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a tender smile.</i>] I had an idea you'd be glad I escaped.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>All I've suffered has been worth while. I've done something for you,
<a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a>haven't I? And even something for England ... I'm so tired.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Why don't you go to bed, darling?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>No, I don't want to go yet. I'm too tired. Let me stay here a little
longer.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Put your feet up.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Come and sit close to me, Arthur. I want to be comforted. You're so good
and kind to me, Arthur. I'm so glad I have you. You will never fail me.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Never. [<i>She gives a little shudder.</i>] What's the matter?</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I hope he'll marry her quickly. I want to be a good wife to you. I want
your love. I want your love so badly.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>My dear one.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Put your arms round me. I'm so tired.</p>

<p class="charc"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>You're half asleep.... Are you asleep?</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
